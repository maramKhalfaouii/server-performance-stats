# Server Performance Stats

## About the Project  
This project is part of my learning journey, following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats) guide. It focuses on writing a Bash script (`server-stats.sh`) to monitor and analyze server performance metrics on a Linux system.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
The script provides the following system statistics:  
-  **CPU Usage:** Total CPU utilization percentage  
-  **Memory Usage:** Free vs. used memory, including percentage  
-  **Disk Usage:** Free vs. used disk space, including percentage  
-  **Top Processes by CPU Usage:** The top 5 most CPU-intensive processes  
-  **Top Processes by Memory Usage:** The top 5 most memory-intensive processes  

### ðŸŽ¯ Stretch Goals  
Additional enhancements that can be included:  
- ðŸ”¹ OS version  
- ðŸ”¹ System uptime  
- ðŸ”¹ Load average  
- ðŸ”¹ Logged-in users  
- ðŸ”¹ Failed login attempts  

This project is a hands-on exercise to strengthen my Linux scripting and system monitoring skills. It is part of the Server Stats Project from roadmap.sh, helping me build a solid foundation in system administration.
